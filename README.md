# Radicalism-in-America
*Just how accurate are media portrayals of radicalism in America?*

By Jacquie Nesbitt & Hannah Gross | MIDS Spring 2021 | hannah.gross@berkeley.edu

Throughout history, stories of radicalism in the media have helped shape the American identity through the use of othering. By media portrayals of radicalized individuals, we can be sure that we arenâ€™t one of *them*. But how accurate are these media portrayals of radicalism in America?

### Easter Egg!
We encourage those who are curious to check out our [chord graph](https://github.com/hannah144/Radicalism-in-America/blob/cce9aa119c37f408fc776a1168be591ecbf4706d/Final%20Jupyter%20Notebooks/habitation_vs_plot_locations.ipynb) depicting flows from habitation to plot location by radicals recorded in PIRUS. Users can choose to filter the PIRUS data by terrorist organization to get a sense of that organization's geography. Additionally, due to time constraints, our chord graph has yet to be fully realized, and so we leave it to the better minds to refine and interpret.  &#10084;&#65039; Hannah
