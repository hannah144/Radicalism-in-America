# Radicalism-in-America
*Just how accurate are media portrayals of radicalism in America?*

From the election of Donald Trump to the January 6th insurrection, radicalism has become an increasing salient issue in the United States. So much so that since the insurrection, both sides of the aisle in Congress have proposed new bills to establish a commission to investigate domestic extremism. Then on March 2, 2021, FBI Director Christopher Wray stated that violent domestic terrorism has been ‘metastasizing’ in America and the trend is unlikely to change. And just five days prior to writing this sentence, President Biden allocated $111 million dollars to combat domestic terrorism in his first budget proposal. At this point in history, there is no doubt that attention to radicalism in America has reached a peak only precedented by the aftermath of 9/11.

Throughout history, stories of radicalism in the media have helped shape the American identity through the use of othering. For example, during the Cold War, the media paid careful attention to Marxists, and made sure that the world knew that Americans were completely against communism. Rather, we were the antithesis, the gold standard of democracy and capitalism. By media portrayals of radicalized individuals, we can be sure that we aren’t one of *them*. But how accurate are these media portrayals of radicalism in America?

Users can choose to filter the PIRUS data by terrorist organization to get a sense of that organization's geography. Additionally, due to time constraints, our chord graph has yet to be fully realized, and so we leave it to the better minds to refine and interpret.  &#10084;&#65039; Hannah
